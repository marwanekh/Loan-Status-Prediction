# Loan Status Prediction

' This repository contains a Python project for predicting loan status using machine learning techniques. The project utilizes various libraries and tools for data analysis, visualization, and classification.

### Libraries Used
- **NumPy (np)**: NumPy is used for numerical computing and array operations.
- **Pandas (pd)**: Pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Seaborn (sns)**: Seaborn is used for statistical data visualization.
- **Matplotlib.pyplot (plt)**: Matplotlib is used for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.
- **scikit-learn**: Scikit-learn is used for machine learning tasks, including model training, evaluation, and prediction.
  - **svm**: Support Vector Machine classifier.
  - **train_test_split**: Used for splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
  - **accuracy_score**: Used to evaluate the accuracy of the model.

### Project Overview
This project aims to predict the status of loan applications based on various features. It utilizes a dataset containing information about loan applicants and their loan status.

### How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required dependencies.
   
4. Run the Python script `loan_status_prediction.py` to train the model and make predictions.

### Files
- **loan_status_prediction.py**: Python script containing the implementation of the loan status prediction model.

### Dataset
The dataset contains information about loan applicants and their loan status. It is not included in this repository.

### Model Training
The model is trained using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. After training, the model's accuracy is evaluated using the test set.
